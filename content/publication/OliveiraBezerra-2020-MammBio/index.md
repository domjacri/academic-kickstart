abstract: Previous studies exploring the rhythmic activity of sloths of the Bradypus genus in undisturbed forests revealed cathemeral patterns of activity. In the current study we wished to examine sloth behavior in a highly disturbed secondary forest habitat. We evaluated activity pattern, time budget and rhythmic activities of brown-throated three-toed sloths (B. variegatus) living in the border of a highly disturbed forest fragment in northeastern Brazil. Three adults (2 females and 1 male) and 2 infants were studied over 29 days. Observational data were collected in 15 min increments over the 24-h day in the following categories: resting, moving, travelling, eating and grooming. Time series data were subjected to X2 periodogram, Fourier (Fast Fourier Transformation, FFT), cosinor and CircWave circadian rhythm analysis, and revealed significant 24-h rhythms in all behaviors in most circumstances. Unlike sloths located in an undisturbed forest, this population exhibited primarily diurnal activity patterns of behavior, with the center of gravity for each behavior occurring in the middle of the day. Furthermore, several behaviors were expressed in a bimodal pattern, with a morning and a late afternoon peak of activity. These data suggest that with decreased predator presence and with a more ubiquitous food source, sloths adjust their temporal niche to daytime.
