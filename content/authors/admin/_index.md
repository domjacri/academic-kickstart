Dom Acri was born and raised in Harrisburg, PA. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a bachelors in neuroscience & behavior, Dom's research interests shifted from behavioral ecology to molecular genetics. By combining wet and dry laboratory techniques, he now spends his days (_and sometimes nights_) researching Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. Dom plans to pursue a career in academia, with a focus on genetic modifiers of neurodegenerative diseases.

Dom also has a particular passion for DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion). He is an active member of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).
