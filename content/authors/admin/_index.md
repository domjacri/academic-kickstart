Dom Acri is a neuroscientist and bioinformatician interested in understanding the innate immune system of aging brains. After training in mouse models of neurodegeneration during his dissertation work in the laboratory of Dr. Jungsu Kim at Indiana University School of Medicine, Dom is currently continuing his training in age-related neurodegeneration with Dr. Mark Cookson in the National Institute on Aging's (NIH/NIA) Laboratory of Neurogenetics - Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section. His expertise includes collecting and analyzing data from various *transcriptomic* assays, understanding *epigenetic* states using methylation and chromatin accessibilty assays, and functionally validated computationally predicted modifiers of ADRD-risk using *iPSC*-derived cell culture. Dom plans to pursue a career in academia, with a focus on genetic modifiers of glial cells in the aging brain.

Dom also has a particular passion for DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion). He is an enrolled member of the Sicangu Lakota (Rosebud Sioux Tribe), active member of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), and the co-founder of Natives In Neuroscience.
