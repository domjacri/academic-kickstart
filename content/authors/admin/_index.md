Dom Acri was born and raised in Harrisburg, PA. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a bachelors in neuroscience & behavior, Dom decided he wanted to explore the worlds of big data and medical research. By combining fundamental research in animals, genomic data, and next generation molecular tools, he spends his days (_and sometimes nights_) researching Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.
