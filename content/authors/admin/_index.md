'Problems that appear small are large problems that are not understood'-_Santiago Ramon y Cajal_

Dom Acri was born and raised in Harrisburg, PA. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a bachelors in neuroscience & behavior, Dom decided he wanted to explore the worlds of big data and medical research. By combining basic research, human data, and next generation molecular tools, he spends his days (_and sometimes nights_) exploring the genetics of the brain.
