Awarded in May 2018 and taking effect during the 2018-2019 Academic year, Dom was selected from a campus-wide competition of recruitment fellows to receive the Graduate Diversity Fellowship. The award was presented as part of the Graduate School Emmissaries Reception by Dr. Tabitha Hardy, Assistant Dean for Student Development and Academic Affairs. This fellowship includes full support--tuition, stipend, insurance, and program fees totaling approximately $50,000. In addition the fellowship includes a travel award which will help send Dom to Cold Spring Harbor for a Single Cell Genomics conference in the fall of 2019.
