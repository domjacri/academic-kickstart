Increased participation of underrepresented minority scholars in advanced STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and training is critical for supporting the development of a diverse professional STEM workforce — especially a diverse STEM faculty who can serve as the intellectual, professional, personal and organizational role models who shape the expectations of future scientists and engineers.

Dom was named to the Doctoral Scholars program in 2018 and attends the SREB's annual Institute on Teaching and Mentoring. There he connects with fellow indigenous acadmics of all disciplines to form community and learn about careers in academia.
