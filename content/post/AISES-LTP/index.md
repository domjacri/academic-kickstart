The “Lighting the Pathway to Faculty Careers for Natives in STEM” (LTP) program provides full circle of support to American Indians, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars who are on the pathway to becoming STEM faculty. This full circle of support includes mentorship, travel funding, and educational/research/ fellowship/internship opportunities. The LTP program was originally awarded a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2014. Then in the summer of 2019, LTP received a second 5-year NSF grant to continue as LTP Phase II.

Dom was selected to the third cohort of the LTP program for the 2021-2023 academic years. His work was selected to be featured at the 2021 American Indian Science and Engineering Society's National Conference in Phoenix, Arizona.
